## Introduction
this is basically a Hiring Platform, Our Platformâ€™s role starts when a recruiter posts a job vacancy on our platform and those who are interested apply for it. From this moment on we will provide several plugin modules for the recruiter to customize all the hiring pipeline based on how the recruiter wants to evaluate the applied candidates.
